# MODULE 7: How to Earn Income and Pay Zero Tax

This module shows business owners how to earn multiple six figures and legally eliminate federal income tax â€” not through loopholes, but through structured, layered strategy.

The ultimate goal of tax planning isn't just to reduce taxes â€” it's to create a systematic approach where business income generates ongoing deductions that eliminate tax liability while building wealth-producing assets. Smart business owners don't just earn income; they create income engines that produce both cash flow and tax benefits simultaneously.

You'll learn how to:
- Use oil & gas to generate up to 90% deductions  
- Convert real estate losses into active deductions using REPS  
- Use bonus depreciation from business acquisitions  
- Extract capital from your MSO tax-free using split-dollar strategies

**Key Principle:** Zero-tax income isn't about avoiding obligations â€” it's about structuring income generation to create legitimate deductions that offset taxable income while building appreciating assets.
