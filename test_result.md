Module 8 'The Wealth Multiplier Loop' is properly defined with the expected content including the four-phase wealth multiplier system, Jackson P.'s case study showing $2.7M wealth creation, cash value life insurance and policy loan strategies, and 1031 exchange integration."

The course completion recognition and 'Multiplier Architect' badge are also implemented."
