    message: "I've tested the IRS Escape Plan platform to verify Module 6 'Short-Term Rentals (STRs)' addition. The backend API shows that Module 6 has been added to the W-2 Escape Plan course, but it's not accessible through the UI. The course does not show 6 total lessons and 6 estimated hours, and Module 6 is not visible in the course content. The UI needs to be updated to display Module 6 and its content."

The frontend needs to be updated to display Module 6 in the W-2 Escape Plan course, show 6 total lessons and 6 estimated hours, and allow access to Module 6 content including the STR exemption explanation, Helen Park's case study, cost segregation strategy, and material participation requirements."
