        comment: "Code analysis confirms that the W-2 Escape Plan course has been implemented with all 8 modules in the backend. Module 8 'The Wealth Multiplier Loop' is properly defined with the expected content including the four-phase wealth multiplier system, Jackson P.'s case study showing $2.7M wealth creation, cash value life insurance and policy loan strategies, and 1031 exchange integration."

        comment: "Module 8 quiz has been implemented with the 4 required wealth building questions: 'What is the Wealth Multiplier Loop designed to do?', 'What is a key feature of the life insurance used in this strategy?', 'How are STRs used in the loop?', and 'What is the tax benefit of a 1031 exchange at the end of the loop?'. The course completion recognition and 'Multiplier Architect' badge are also implemented."
