# MODULE 4: Erasing Income with Strategic Deductions

This module shows how high-income business owners erase taxable income using code-based strategies â€” without loopholes or audit exposure.

Students will learn how to:
- Layer oil & gas, REPS, and cost segregation  
- Offset active income with passive investments  
- Turn tax savings into real, cash-flowing assets

Tax deductions aren't just about reducing what you owe â€” they're about systematically converting business income into wealth-building assets that generate ongoing cash flow while eliminating current tax liability.

## The Strategic Deduction Framework

### Beyond Traditional Deductions

**Traditional Business Deductions:**
- Office expenses, meals, travel
- Equipment and software purchases
- Professional services and marketing
- Maximum annual impact: $25K-$50K

**Strategic Deduction Stack:**
- Oil & gas investment deductions
- Real estate professional depreciation
- Cost segregation accelerated write-offs
- Maximum annual impact: $250K-$1M+

**Key Principle:** Strategic deductions create assets that appreciate and generate income while providing immediate tax benefits.

### The Three-Pillar Deduction Strategy

**Pillar 1: Oil & Gas Investments (IRC Â§263)**
- 70-85% immediate deduction via Intangible Drilling Costs (IDC)
- Active income treatment for working interests
- Ongoing production revenue from successful wells
- Depletion allowances for additional tax benefits

**Pillar 2: Real Estate Professional Status (REPS)**
- Removes passive loss limitations on rental real estate
- Allows unlimited depreciation against active business income
- Material participation unlocks full deduction potential
- Builds long-term appreciating asset portfolio

**Pillar 3: Cost Segregation Studies**
- Accelerates building depreciation from 27.5/39 years to 5/7/15 years
- Creates substantial first-year deductions through bonus depreciation
- Engineering-based methodology provides audit protection
- Maximizes tax benefits from real estate investments
